## Description

**BudgetBuddy** is a budgeting app that keeps you on top of your finances. You can add multiple budgets with unique names. No other user can see the budgets you've created.

## Budget includes

- total income
- expences
    - rent
    - other bills
    - food
    - clothing
- total +/-

*this is the rough plan and other categories can be added later on*

## Functionality ✔️

- Before logging in ✔️
    - user can register with an unique username and password
    - user can log in to the app with an existing username and the matching password
- After logged in ✔️
    - user sees all own budgets in the mainview
    - user can create new budget (with unique name)
    - user can 'enter' to specific budget page
        - budget can be filled --> budget is made to look like a form
    - user can log out

## Additional ideas

- expanding the budget categories (user could add it themselves) ✔️
- description for budgets
- editing budgets (name, categories) ✔️ *can edit categories*
- adding graphics (tables, diagrams)

# Testing document

The program has been tested with Unittest.

## App logic

The class `BudgetService`, that is responsible of app logic, is being tested with the test class [TestBudgetService](https://github.com/eveliinaalikoski/ohte-harjoitustyo/blob/master/src/tests/budget_service_test.py). `BudgetService` -object is initialized so that it has repository-objects as dependencies. For this reason in tests there is `BudgetRepositoryTests` and `UserRepositoryTests` in use.
